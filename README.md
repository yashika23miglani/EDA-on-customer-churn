# EDA-on-customer-churn
Overview
This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer churn data. Using pandas, we'll read the dataset, clean it, treat outliers, and perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand factors influencing customer churn.
Approach
We'll follow these steps to conduct the EDA:
1. Data Reading with Pandas
We'll use pandas to read the dataset into a DataFrame.
The dataset contains information about customers and their churn status.
2. Data Cleaning
We'll clean the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
Cleaning steps may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
3. Outlier Treatment
Outliers can skew analysis results, so we'll identify and treat outliers appropriately.
Techniques like trimming, winsorizing, or imputation may be used to address outliers.
4. Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis involves examining individual variables in the dataset.
We'll calculate summary statistics, visualize distributions, and identify patterns in each variable.
5. Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis explores relationships between pairs of variables.
We'll analyze the relationship between the target variable (churn) and other independent variables using visualizations and statistical tests.
